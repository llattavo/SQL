SELECT Customerid, FirstName, LastName, Country 
FROM customers
WHERE Country <> 'USA';

#2. Show only the Customers from Brazil.

SELECT Customerid, FirstName, LastName, Country 
FROM customers

#3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.

SELECT FirstName, LastName, Invoiceid, InvoiceDate, BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices invoices 
LEFT JOIN chinook.customers customers
ON invoices.CustomerId = customers.CustomerId

#4. Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.

SELECT * FROM chinook.Employees
WHERE Title = "Sales Support Agent" ;

#5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.

SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry FROM chinook.Invoices ;

#6. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.

SELECT employees.FirstName, employees.LastName, invoices.InvoiceId
FROM chinook.employees employees
JOIN chinook.customers customers
ON employees.EmployeeId = customers.SupportRepId
JOIN chinook.invoices invoices
ON customers.CustomerId = invoices.CustomerId;

#7. Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.

SELECT cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, cust.Country, inv.Total, emp.FirstName, emp.LastName
FROM chinook.employees emp

JOIN chinook.invoices inv
ON cust.CustomerId = inv.CustomerId;

#8. How many Invoices were there in 2009?

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate LIKE '2009%';

#9. What are the total sales for 2009?

#10. Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.

SELECT t.Name, i.InvoiceLineId

#11. Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.

SELECT ar.name as Artist, t.Name AS Track, i.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.Invoice_items i
LEFT JOIN chinook.Tracks t 
ON i.TrackId = t.TrackId
INNER JOIN chinook.albums al
ON t.AlbumId = al.AlbumId
LEFT JOIN chinook.artists ar
ON al.ArtistId = ar.ArtistId
GROUP BY Artist;

#12. Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.

SELECT t.Name AS 'Track Name', a.Title AS 'Album Title', m.Name AS 'Media Type', g.Name as 'Genre'

#13. Show the total sales made by each sales agent.

SELECT ROUND(SUM(Invoices.Total), 2) as 'Total Sales', e.LastName, e.FirstName
FROM chinook.employees e

JOIN chinook.Invoices
ON c.CustomerId=invoices.CustomerId
WHERE e.Title='Sales Support Agent'
GROUP BY e.FirstName;

#14. Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?

SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName,
ROUND(SUM(Inv.Total), 2) as 'Total Sales'

JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv 
ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId
WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent'

GROUP BY emp.FirstName
ORDER BY (round(sum(Inv.Total), 2))  DESC LIMIT 1;
